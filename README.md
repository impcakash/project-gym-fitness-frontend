This is a clone of planetfitness.com. Planet Fitness is a franchisor and operator of fitness centres. It provides a high-quality workout experience at an affordable cost. It also has different membership options, so we can pick the one that works best for us. All of our PF locations have a variety of high-quality, brand-name cardio and strength equipment.

This website is fully responsive and behaves the same as planetfitness.com in functionality.
